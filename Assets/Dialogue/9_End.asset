  - Well, at least part of this trail stayed the same! Beacon Falls, in all her glory.
  - "Wow\u2026 even with all the stuff on the trail, I\u2019m surprised we\u2019re
    the only ones here."
  - "That\u2019s the same too. This was always a trail for the curious and the lost."
  - "My family and I were both the first time we found it!\r"
  - "Hah\u2026well, it was worth it."
  - ...
  - ...
  - "I\u2026"
  - "I keep thinking about how when I\u2019m gone, nobody will ever look at this
    place like me again.\r"
  - Yeah?
  - "Yeah, it\u2019s just\u2026it sounds selfish, or self-righteous. Both, probably.
    But all those things I told you I saw, and felt\u2026"
  - Dying's one thing. I can accept that even if it's scary.
  - "But I\u2019m sad about all the thoughts and dreams I\u2019m leaving behind,
    and I wish I knew there was someone out there who dreamt like me."
  - ...
  - "\rIsn't what makes us all who we are the fact that nobody dreams like you?"
  - "Heh. Yeah, I guess you\u2019re right."
  - But I love what I dream so much, and I guess what I really want is for someone
    else to know that love.
  - Hmm.
  - ...
  - By your own logic, I think a lot of people do. They love their dreams just as
    much, and a little bit differently. Like the valley.
  - ...
  - "Yeah, that\u2026that makes sense."
  - ...
  - Thanks for coming with me.
  - "Yeah, of course, it was\u2026\r"
  - "...\r"
  - "I, uh...\r"
  - "...\r"
  - "*sniff*\r"
  - "Hey, hey, it\u2019s alright. It\u2019s ok."
  - "Y-yeah, I\u2019m\u2026"
  - "I just thought about how I\u2019ll always think of you when I think about this
    place, now."
  - "I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s a sad thing or a happy one."
  - ...
  - Happy.
  - Y-you're pretty sure for someone who's dying.
  - "It means I\u2019m part of it. Part of the sky, and the rock, and the valleys.
    Like the traveller in that poem you mentioned - I\u2019m part of the sea."
  - Home, forevermore.
  - "I don\u2019t think I could ask for much better."
  - ...
  - '*sniff*'
  - Y-yeah. That sounds happy.
  - ...
  - ...
  - ...Do you wanna get lunch after this?
  - Hah. Yeah, I think so. That sounds good.
  - Do you wanna stay and watch the falls a bit longer?
  - Actually...
  - I think I'm ready to go.
