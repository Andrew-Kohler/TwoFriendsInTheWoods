  - Are you alright?
  - Yeah! That was great! Remember when you threw me onto your parents roof?
  - ...yeah, actually. You fell off and smashed through a table.
  - Oh, yeah. I forgot that part. All I remember was being so happy that we got me
    up there.
  - All I remember was my parents saying that was their favorite table.
  - Heh...yeah. But we got to sleep over anyway.
  - Hah, we did, yeah. Almost forgot that part.
  - You sure that wasn't too much?
  - Pretty sure. We can stop and sit soon anyway though.
