  - It's amazing, isn't it?
  - Yeah.
  - .....
  - I feel like you like it more, somehow.
  - Maybe I just like it differently.
  - How so?
  - Hmmm.
  - ...
  - Look out there and tell me what you see. Just, say whatever you're feeling.
  - Uh, ok.
  - ...
  - Black and white and black and white, going out as far as I can see, into nothing.
    Trees, mountains...there's a bird over there.
  - It all sort of...echoes into itself, I guess.
  - But it's peaceful. It's quiet and special. All those trees and birds and things,
    in harmony with each other. We could learn from it.
  - ...
  - That was lovely.
  - ...thanks. I've been reading some poetry.
  - I thought you hated poetry.
  - '"The tide rises, the tide falls."'
  - You *definitely* didn't quote poetry the last time we talked.
  - Well, it's been a while.
  - ...
  - So, what was that for?
  - Oh, right. You asked how I liked it differently. My turn.
  - When I look out there, I see life. Trees growing, birds soaring, leaves falling
    to the ground and starting the whole circle over again.
  - 'The sky is open and wide and full of promise, like you could run into it forever. '
  - "The clouds are as hot as the rocks in the sun until you touch them, and then
    they\u2019re cool and welcoming."
  - But even more than that, this land is old. Its souls, the very being of everything
    that has ever lived here, still darts through the forest.
  - Rustles the leaves.
  - It is everything we see.
  - "That age, that wear\u2026the sag of the trees, the grain of the rock. The smell
    of a mat of dry needles and leaves warmed by the afternoon heat...."
  - "It\u2019s like a hug. Every valley reaches out its arms and tells me I am safe."
  - 'This place has its ghost stories, like anywhere else. Strangers, monsters, snakes.
    But here, I know them. '
  - Cast me somewhere else in the world, and I must meet the trees and valleys again.
    It would take another lifetime to truly love them.
  - "But here, I\u2019m home."
  - ...
  - You haven't changed a bit.
  - I'm told I've gotten worse, actually.
  - I don't mind.
