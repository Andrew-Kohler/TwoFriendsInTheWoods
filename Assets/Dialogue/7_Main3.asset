  - How's your family doing?
  - Not great. I think all any of them can think about is how much longer they've
    got me.
  - Yeah, that makes sense.
  - I've been telling them it's ok, you know? That being scared is a waste of time.
  - You aren't scared?
  - Are you kidding? I'm terrified.
  - You don't look like you are.
  - ...
  - Well, people say I hide it well.
  - Heh.
  - What?
  - Something we still have in common.
  - ...
  - ...
  - So, how's your family?
  - They're doing alright.
  - ...
  - I...
  - I have a kid now.
  - What?! That's wonderful, congratulations! Since when?
  - She was born a few months ago. Her name's Sarah.
  - Aw, that's amazing. I'm so happy for you!
  - ...
  - Why didn't you send me anything? A card, a text? I would have sent a gift.
  - I thought about it, but...
  - ...
  - I don't know. You were so far away.
  - ...
  - I guess I was.
  - Sorry for not calling more. I... I wish I had.
  - Me too.
